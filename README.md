# JavaRush Telegram Bot

JavaRush Telegram bot from community for community. Written by developers, who learned in [JavaRush](https://javarush.ru).

## Idea
The main idea is to show how to create real application, which can be used by someone else.
There are [set of posts](https://javarush.ru/groups/posts/2935-java-proekt-ot-a-do-ja-pishem-realjhnihy-proekt-dlja-portfolio), which are describing step by step guidelines of how it was created.

## MVP Scope
As a user, I want to subscribe on group of posts and get notification via telegram-bot every time,
when new post, related to group subscriptions, has come.
